      When I was in middle school one of my good friends had introduced me to
      photography. I really enjoyed the idea of capturing important and unique
      moments in creative ways. Every photo has a unique story and going back
      and looking at photos and videos is really the only way you can relive
      those moments. To this day I still really enjoy doing photography when I
      can. I have posted a lot of my work to Flickr if you would like to check
      it out.{" "}

      Iâ€™ve always had an interest in computer programming, specifically web
      development. This lead to researching and finding the resources I would
      need to create my own applications. This growth in skills allowed me to be
      awarded an internship at Career Karma.

    <div>
      I really enjoy renewable energy, electric vehicles, as well as autonomous
      vehicles because of their ability to make society better, safer, and more
      efficient. These are all things that, given the opportunity, I would love
      to contribute to one day. Until then I love doing little side projects and
      keeping up with the advancements in these fields.

      Electronics are the building blocks of all modern technology. None of my
      favorite hobbies in their current form would exist without electronics.
      Back in 2014, I had built my first electric bike using recycled battery
      cells, which eventually caught on fire, but it was a really fun project
      and I learned a lot. Following this, I joined the Air Force and went
      through electronics course and that laid the foundation to some of the
      hobby projects that I build now using Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. I am
      also happy to report I have built more electric bikes that have not caught
      on fire.
