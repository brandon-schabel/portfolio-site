I served four years in the Air Force as a Ground Radar Technician. I
          joined in April 2015, from there I went through basic training for two
          months, following that I went to technical training where I went
          through a Basic Electronics course, then I went through about 6 months
          of Radar Theory. \n
          
          From there I was assigned to to the 60th OSS at
          Travis AFB. I went through another year of training there to finally
          be certified as a Radar Technician. At Travis AFB we had a unique
          oppurtunity to test an experimental Radar that would help better
          identify airplanes flying over windmills, radars have a hardtime
          seeing airplanes over windmills due to the way radars identify
          airplanes. In addition to my main job, I was also had the oppurtunity
          to serve on the base honor guard where we went and did honors for

          \n
          fallen veterans. I also got to serve on the squadron Booster Club as
          Treasurer, we held events for the squadron and raised funds to hold
          holiday events for the squadron. During my time at Travis my career
          field was merged with another career field called Air Field systems.
          During that transisition my fellow airman and I were responsible for
          training 7 personnel on all the Radar equipment and that was complete
          7 months ahead of time. Due to my efforts and performance, I was
          recognized as a top performer and was promoted to the rank of E-4 6
          months early.

My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer
`

export const rightColumnDescription = `
Before I joined the Air Force I was already very passionate about
          computers and was very confident as time went on that computers would
          become very important in our daily lives. I was already dabbling basic
          python and web development, and found it really fun. Eventually I
          decided I wanted to become a software engineer but it wasn't clear
          what a good way to get there was, so I joined the Air Force to give me
          unique perspectives and experiences that I wouldn't be able to get
          anywhere else, as well as the resources to figure what I needed to do
          to become a software engineer. After I started Technical Training, I
          started to learn how to program again mostly with python scripts and
          arduino. Fast forward to when I arrived at Travis AFB, I decided I was
          going to take this programming this very serious. I had learned about
          Free Code Camp and as soon as I saw the curriculm, I knew it was
          exactly what I was looking for. I started working on the challenges
          everyday, and eventually became proficient enough with JavaScript that
          I felt comfortable exploring how to use frotend libraries like React
          and Vue. I settled on Vue for my first framework due to the ease of
          use and use Python's Flask web server to create my first real
          full-stack app, which was just a little app where I could could
          organize my hobby hardware. After I had learned how to build a web app
          it felt like I had a new super power and I was addicted. I started
          exploring other more commonly used technology like NodeJS as my server
          and React on the frontend. I was addicted to building out new
          applications and now I have built everything from a Portable Raspberry
          Pi Weather Station to being able to connect to an API and display
          data analytics. Eventually I was introduced to the guys who run the
          "Breaking Into Startups" podcast, Artur, Timur, and Ruben, through
          Jordan - a great friend I met in the Air Force, and they were starting
          a new company called Career Karma. I told them about a program the Air
          Force has called DoD Skillbridge that allows you to do an internship
          for the last 6 months of your enlistment. After I had showed them I
          could code in React they gave me the oppurtunity to intern with them.
          From there we have grown Career Karma from a simple MVP to a fully
          fledged platform to help people like me who come from non traditional
          background find their way into tech. I am excited to see what kinds of
          product I will help build next.
