    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served four years in the Air Force as a Radar Technician. After joining in
    April of 2015, I went through basic training for two months. Following that
    I went through an Electronics course, then I went through about six months
    of Radar Theory. From there I was assigned to to the 60th OSS at Travis Air
    Force Base(AFB). I went through another year of training there to finally be
    certified as a Radar Technician. At Travis AFB we had a unique opportunity
    to test an experimental radar that would better help identify airplanes
    flying over windmills; radars have a hard time seeing airplanes over
    windmills due to the way radars identify airplanes.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to my main
    job, I also had the opportunity to serve on the base honor guard where we
    went and performned honors for fallen veterans. Additionally, I served on the
    squadron Booster Club as Treasurer; we raised funds to hold events, such as
    during holidays, for the squadron. During my time at Travis my career field
    was merged with another career field called Airfield Systems. During that
    transition my fellow airmen and I were responsible for training seven
    personnel on all the radar equipment, a task which we completed seven months
    ahead of time. Due to my efforts and performance, I was recognized as a top
    performer and was promoted to the rank of E-4 six months early.

My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

    I’ve always had an interest in programming, specifically web development.
    This lead to me finding the resources to learn how to create my own
    applications. Those skills allowed me to land an internship at Career Karma.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I joined the Air Force I was already very
    passionate about computers and was confident as time went on that computers
    carved out an important niche in our daily lives. In high school, I was
    already dabbling in basic Python and web development, and found it really
    fun. Eventually I decided I wanted to become a software engineer, but there
    wasn’t a clear way to get there. So I joined the Air Force to give me unique
    perspectives and experiences that I wouldn't be able to get anywhere else,
    as well as the resources to figure what I needed to do to become a software
    engineer.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I started Technical Training, I started to
    learn how to program again, mostly with python scripts and arduino. Fast
    forward to when I arrived at Travis AFB, I decided I was going to take
    programming seriously. I had learned about Free Code Camp and as soon as I
    saw the curriculum, I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. I started
    working on the challenges everyday, and eventually became proficient enough
    with JavaScript that I felt comfortable exploring how to use front-end
    libraries like React and Vue. I settled on Vue for my first front-end
    library due to the ease of use and used Python's Flask web server to create
    my first real full-stack app. It was a little app where I could could
    organize my hobby hardware. After I had learned how to build a web app it
    felt like I had a new superpower and I was addicted.
    <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started exploring other more commonly used
    technology like NodeJS as my server and React on the front-end. I have built
    projects ranging from a Portable Raspberry Pi Weather Station to being able
    to connect to an API and display data analytics. Eventually I was introduced
    to the people who run the "Breaking Into Startups" podcast(Artur Meyster,
    Timur Meyster, and Ruben Harris) through Jordan Jackson, a great friend I
    met in the Air Force, and they were starting a new company called Career
    Karma. I told them about a program the Air Force has called DoD Skillbridge
    that allows you to do an internship for the last six months of your
    enlistment. After showing them I could code in React they gave me the
    opportunity to intern with them. From there we have grown Career Karma from
    the minimum viable product to a fully fledged platform with over 4000 users
    now. The focus of Career Karma is to help people like me who come from non
    traditional backgrounds find their way into tech. I am excited to see what
    kinds of product I will help build next.
